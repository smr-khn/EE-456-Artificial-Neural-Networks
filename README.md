# Traffic Object Detection Neural Network
For this project, we challenged ourselves to create an object detection convolutional neural network. One of the most interesting and challenging aspects of this project was getting the neural network to predict the bounding boxes for the detected images. The goal of this project was to be able to detect vehicles in a video of a road with traffic, which it was able to do successfully.

We used TensorFLow and trained our own network using Pascal VOC 2007 and tested it on a traffic video we found online. Results and a report can be found in the final project res folder. main1.py and main2.py are pervious we tried and failed with while finalproject.py is our working script.
## Contents
In the Final Project folder, you will find all of the scripts regarding loading the data, training, and then running the NN on the video frames.
